# Public Transport App

The purpose of this app is to make it easier for general public to plan their trip when using public transport. The idea behind this app is to influence people
to take public transport, reduce air pollution, less environmental damage and reducing petrol usage. This app is directed for smaller cities such as Taupo, Gisborne
Hawkes Bay, Palmerston North, Wairoa and other smaller regions. These smaller cities are lacking a service that provides clear information about the public transport 
in their regions. This solution is aimed for students, working people, elderly and event-goers.
This app was created solely for regional councils to keep track of their bus drivers, buses and public feedback.
As this app progresses, it can be expanded to add other public transports such as trains, ferry and airplanes.
